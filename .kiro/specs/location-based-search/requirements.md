# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature is for building a volunteer match website called VolunteerManiac which helps people connect with their community and achieve their volunteering goals. The scope and requirements are there should be a search box for people to input the city and country where they live and a "search" button for them to click search and find volunteer opportunities in the area. There should be different filters for volunteer opportunities based on causes - human rights, animals, arts & cultures, children & youth, Technology, Education, Health & medicine, Disaster Assistance, Employment, Environment, Homelessness, Hunger, etc. It will implement internet-based search capabilities, geolocation services, distance-based filtering, and improved location input handling to help users find real volunteer opportunities from various online sources based on their location preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want to search for real volunteer opportunities from the internet using location input, so that I can find actual opportunities available in my area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a location and searches THEN the system SHALL query external volunteer opportunity APIs and websites
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display real volunteer opportunities from multiple sources
3. WHEN no internet connection is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN external APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt to search alternative sources and inform the user of any limitations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want to search for opportunities using my current location, so that I can quickly find nearby volunteer opportunities without manually typing my location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Use My Location" button THEN the system SHALL request geolocation permission from the browser
2. WHEN geolocation permission is granted THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the location search field with the user's current city and country
3. WHEN geolocation permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message explaining how to manually enter location
4. IF geolocation is not supported by the browser THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to manual location entry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want to search for opportunities within a specific distance from my location, so that I can find opportunities that are realistically accessible to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a location THEN the system SHALL provide a distance radius selector (5, 10, 25, 50, 100+ miles)
2. WHEN a distance radius is selected THEN the system SHALL include the distance parameter in external API searches
3. WHEN no distance is specified THEN the system SHALL default to a reasonable radius (25 miles) for internet searches
4. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL filter and sort opportunities based on calculated distance from the search location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want intelligent location suggestions as I type, so that I can quickly select the correct location without typing the full address.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the location search field THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions for cities, states, and countries
2. WHEN the user selects a suggestion THEN the system SHALL populate the search field with the selected location
3. WHEN suggestions are displayed THEN the system SHALL show relevant location details (city, state, country)
4. IF no suggestions match the input THEN the system SHALL allow the user to proceed with their manual input

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want to see opportunities sorted by distance from my search location, so that I can prioritize the most accessible opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the distance from the search location for each opportunity
2. WHEN multiple opportunities are found THEN the system SHALL sort results by distance (closest first) by default
3. WHEN the user selects a different sorting option THEN the system SHALL maintain distance information in the display
4. WHEN an opportunity is virtual THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate it has no physical distance requirement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want to search for opportunities in multiple locations simultaneously, so that I can find opportunities when I'm flexible about location or traveling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters multiple locations separated by commas THEN the system SHALL search for opportunities in all specified locations
2. WHEN multiple locations are searched THEN the system SHALL group results by location in the display
3. WHEN displaying multi-location results THEN the system SHALL indicate which location each opportunity belongs to
4. WHEN no opportunities are found in some locations THEN the system SHALL still show results from locations that have matches

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want the system to remember my location preferences, so that I don't have to re-enter my location every time I search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully searches with a location THEN the system SHALL store the location preference in browser local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the search page THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the location field with their last used location
3. WHEN the user clears their location THEN the system SHALL remove the stored location preference
4. WHEN the user uses geolocation THEN the system SHALL update the stored preference with the detected location

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a volunteer, I want the system to integrate with multiple volunteer opportunity data sources, so that I can access a comprehensive list of available opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system searches for opportunities THEN it SHALL query multiple volunteer opportunity APIs (VolunteerMatch, JustServe, Idealist, etc.)
2. WHEN multiple data sources return results THEN the system SHALL merge and deduplicate opportunities from different sources
3. WHEN a data source is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue searching other available sources
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL indicate the source of each opportunity for transparency
